LACrimBook
===============

LACrimBook aims to replace West's big and expensive handbook of Louisiana 
criminal laws with a free, digital alternative.

**This branch** contains a Web SQL version of the CrimBook for usage with PhoneGap applications.  Because of the
large size (approx 7MBs) of the data, Web Sql is the only storage option available.  The desktop branch uses
an in-memory datastore ([jlinq](http://hugoware.net/Projects/jlinq)).

A desktop browser demo can be found [here](http://judsonmitchell.github.io/LACrimBook/).

LACrimBook was created as a part of the [Technology and Legal Innovation Clinic](http://loyolalawtech.org) of [Loyola College of Law, New Orleans](http://law.loyno.edu).
